# Recipe-django
 Recipe Manager is a practice website built with Django that lets users manage their recipes. It includes user authentication (login/logout) and CRUD functionality. Users can create, update, delete, and view recipes. Only logged-in users can manage recipes, with a simple UI for easy navigation and learning core Django features.
